## SGM stat-damage benefit curve graph generator

### Brief

This project is motivated by the desire of seeing how move stats affect the final damage.

Limited by my knowledge and efforts currently it is very cringe now that only involves few functions, but works to my interest.

### Usage

This program requires modules listed in file `requirements.txt`

To  run:

```
streamlit run Main.py
```

Also app version can be accessed in [here](https://sgm-damage-curve-generator.streamlit.app/), and if you are already here see side bar in the right

### Todo

[x] add gui to change values
- add debuffs' influence
- add move selection part
- more flexible and high efficient code format to provide more functions
